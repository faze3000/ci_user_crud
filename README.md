# CodeIgniter 4 Simple CRUD application

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [CodeIgniter 4](https://forum.codeigniter.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=28) on the forums.

The user guide corresponding to the latest version of the framework can be found
[here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/).

## Installation & updates

Clone repo into your local PHP environment and run composer install

## Setup

1. Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
2. Create a blank database i.e simple_crud and edit the database.default on .env file section with your settings
3. Run migrations which will create the users table for you i.e on your command line on project root run php spark migrate
5. For convenience there is a user seeder you can run to populate some data i.e php spark db:seed UserSeeder

Depending on your localhost setup the app should be accessible on URL http://localhost/{yourprojectname}/public/users



## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
